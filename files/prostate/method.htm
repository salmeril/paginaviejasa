      <p>Before and after receiving acupuncture treatment, patients answered the 
        SF-36v2 Health Survey. The survey is a standardized test, which assesses 
        general health-related conditions, such as physical functioning, bodily 
        pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, and mental health. 
        The survey was also used to estimate the overall physical functioning 
        and mental health of the patients. The survey has norms for U.S. population 
        of different ages and gender. </p>

      <p><b>Data Analysis</b></p>
      <p>Paired-Samples T-test analyses were conducted a) to examine individual 
        differences in each of the subscales of the survey, b) to examine group 
        mean differences for each of the scales, and c) to compare the participants 
        with the norms of U.S. population with similar demographic characteristics. 
        Tables and figures were constructed to graphically display the results.</p>
