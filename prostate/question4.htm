      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pre and posttest scores of the eight patients were 
        compared to the U.S. norm male population, age 55-64. First, we compared 
        the mean for physical functioning of the eight patients with the U. S. 
        norm population. We found that for our sample the pre test mean for physical 
        functioning was 49. 10 (SD = 10.58) while the mean for the U.S. norm population 
        was 48.16 (SD = 10.23). These results suggest that initially our sample 
        was very similar to the norm population. We also compared our sample' 
        posttest mean on physical functioning with the U.S. norm population. We 
        found that for our sample, the posttest mean for physical functioning 
        was 52.02 (SD = 8.16), which was higher than the U.S. norm population.</p>
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, we compared the mental health's pre test mean 
        of the eight patients with the U. S. norm population. In our sample, the 
        pre test mean for the mental health scale was 52. 91 (SD = 6.47) and for 
        the U.S norm population was 52. 53 (SD = 9.67). Once again, our sample's 
        pre test mean is similar to the norm population. However, we found that 
        for our sample, the posttest mean for mental health was 55.32 (SD = 3.69), 
        which was higher than the norm population.</p>
